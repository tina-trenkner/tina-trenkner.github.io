        <h3 class="blog">Designing Responsive Websites</h3>
        <p class="body">
          More and more people are accessing the internet via their smartphones -- so it's pretty imperative to design a website or blog with their user experience in mind. News publishers are very aware of this and have adopted an ethos of if it's not mobile, it doesn't work" (paraphrasing Brian Boyer, news app developer at NPR and one of my favourite developers to follow).
        <p>

        <p class="body">
          So let's go over some basic terms you'll hear if you're planning to start or create a website:
        </p>

        <ul class="body">
        <li>What is a responsive website?: A responsive website is one that will look good and function well, regardless of what browser or device you use to access it. It doesn't matter if you're on an iPhone, a tablet, on a MacBookAir or a eff-off ginormous monitor, that website will work well and look good.</li>
        <li>Why do websites need to be mobile-first?: Because more and more people are using mobile devices to search the web. And a typical desktop website will not look as nice on a much smaller monitor. A site might be harder to read, or your thumbs may not be able to click a button as easily. Mobile-friendly websites provide a better user experience. (Also, Google considers mobile-friendliness in its search engine optimisation rankings.)</li>
        <li>
        What are frameworks?: Think of frameworks as clothing patterns. Instead of mapping out the pieces to make a garment, a framework maps out a page with HTML and CSS to create a certain look and function for a website. The pros of them are that it lays everything out easy and nice for you, the cons are that it may take some effort to customise them to whatever you're trying to make.
        </li>
        <li>
        What is a wireframe? A wireframe is basically a visual outline of what your website will look like. You may have a wireframe for what your desktop site will look like and a seperate one for a mobile site. It's a bunch of boxes on a page, that tell you where text and images go. Here are the wireframes of what I'd like this site to look like (inshallah that the site will actually look like this when I try to code it).
        </li>
        </ul>
