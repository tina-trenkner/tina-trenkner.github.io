<h2>HTML, CSS and the DOM</h2>
<p>This week, our cohort reviewed what HTML, CSS and DOM are:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTML is the language used to explain what is on the page: <em>Here is some text. Here is a picture. Here is some text in <strong>bold</strong>.</em> It's basically the foundation for the page.</li>
<li>CSS is like a coat of paint for most of the HTML elements. <em>Oh, CSS says to make the background white, the text black, but says that the title (aka the H2 tag) at the top of the page should be white text on a black background</em>.</li>
<li>DOM is ... truth be told, my notes actually say "What is the DOM?" (It's Thursday and I went through the lesson on Tuesday. Hold on...) The DOM is basically the blueprint the browser uses to set up the page, based on the HTML given.</li>
</ul>

<p>When developers get a picture of what a client wants a website to look like, they may "boxify" the design, meaning they divvy up the various thing on a page into different boxes. A paragraph might be a box. A picture may be a box. A series of pictures may be a box. A media player will be a box. This helps the developer figure out what he or she needs to code. (They do with with div tags.)</p>

<p>So the designer figures out what boxes they need to code. They may need to consider how much space there should be within a box and outside the parameters of the box. He or she will rely on a model called the "box model" which will guide in determining how well spaced the content should be within the borders of the box, and how it sits alongside other elements.</p>

<p>Out of this week's assignments, here's what caught my eye from <a href="http://www.http://www.csszengarden.com/">CSS Zen Garden</a> and what I hope to replicate on this blog:</p>

<ul>
<li>In this <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/221/"> Mid-Century Modern</a> style: More vertical boxes or columns. I like how the vertical features draw the eye down the page (because it is really hard to get a user to scroll down a page.</li>
<li>In <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/181/">Pretty in Pink</a>: The use of color more often and of texture, seen in the diagonal lines in the titles. (It looks like the H3 is a repeating graphic, that's my best guess. </li>
<li>In <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/157/">Bugs</a>, I'm curious about the layering of the bugs over the titles on the page. It's a neat effect. I'm guess that is just an image file as well.</li></ul>

<p>Over the weekend, I'll try to integrate one of these ideas or effects into this here blog. I'm leaning towards adding a column of some sort. Stay tuned.</p>
