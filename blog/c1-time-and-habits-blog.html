<h2>How do you stay sane when your brain is full of commands?</h2>
<p>I appreciated the section on time management and productivity, and was keen to try out some of the strategies:
<ul><li><a href="http://pomodorotechnique.com/">Pomodoro Technique</a>: This technique has you working for 25 minutes, then taking a five minute break. I felt that this technique didn't quite work for me because at the end of 25 minutes, I would feel like there wasn't a stopping point to take a break. What I did do was adapt the technique: I find I work better when I do 45-50  minutes of work, then take a 10-15 minute break.</li><li>Meditation>: I like meditating. I'm persuaded by its health benefits. But I have a difficult time remembering to sit still for 15-20 minutes to do it. So this is a habit I hope to integrate successfully into my life. I like using the <a href="http://www.1giantmind.org/"> 1 Giant Mind app</a>. It's really well laid out, and it's not too "hippy-dippy" (if you're turned off by that.) I really like that after every session, the app presents a menu of questions about your meditation. If you experienced something funny while meditating, there is a video that explains why it happened and what you can do about it.</li><li>Creating the right mindset: I read through some of the Buffer articles, and I like how those articles have a really positive tone to them. I think from these pieces, I just try to keep a positive mindset as I work through the material. Sure, it might be tough, but there's people to rely on and things to Google and resources out there to help with anything that is particularly tough.</li></ul> <p>One thing I do when my brain gets fuzzy and my eyes can't decipher one letter from the next is that I turn away from a screen. I go pick up a book, or go for a walk. I find that stepping away from my screen refreshes me, so that when I return to the computer or the phone, my vision is better and my mind clearer. Do any of you have issues with too much screen time?</p>
