        <h3 class="blog">Javascript basics</h3>
        <p class="body">
          This week, our cohort was introduced to the beast that is JavaScript. JavaScript is different to that of HTML and CSS is that JavaScript tells the page how to behave. HTML and CSS primarily dictate how the page is structured and how it should look. Below, I attempt to answer a few questions about JavaScript, based on my rudimentary knowledge of the programming language so far. (This post will be updated.)
        <p>

        <p class="body">
          <strong>What is control flow and loops and how could I explain them to you?</strong> Control flow basically are rules and conditions that tell a website how to do something - do it be done in a loop? A loop is a series of actions that may be taken, based on defined or undefined parameters. Think of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_47KVJV8DU">singalong</a>. You're told sing the song if you are able to do so, so you do it. And you keep doing it until there's a condition that tells you to stop. Say, it might be to sing the song no more than 5 times. Once you sing it five times, STOP. (For everyone's sake.)
        </p>

        <p class="body">
          <strong>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and object literals.</strong> According the website <a href="http://www.metaltoad.com/blog/javascript-understanding-objects-vs-arrays-and-when-use-them">Metal Toad</a> (and our lessons of course), "arrays have order and objects do not". You can add or take away parts of an array as needed.
        </p>

        <p class="body">
          <strong>Explain what functions are and why they are useful?</strong> Functions are block of code that execute an action when "called upon". Say you want to find out how it costs to take public transportation across town. If you input a starting destination, that data could "call upon" or tell the browser to execute a function that will give you information about how much your trip will cost. They are useful in that they can allow the user to find data very quickly.
