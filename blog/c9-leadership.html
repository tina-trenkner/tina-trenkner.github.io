        <p class="body">
        My experience with compassionate leadership made me think of the time I
        got laid off and how my supervisor handled it. It was tough news to deliver
        and hear, but I appreciated that she let me sit her office and figure
        out my next step. I consider her a mentor to this day, and she's a great
        expert on digital media marketing.

        When I did the "multiplying goodness" meditation exercise as outlined in
        <em>Search Inside Yourself</em>, I felt good. Really good. I think I started
        smirking in the middle of the exercise. The realisation that everyone has
        the potential to create more good is self-reassuring.
        </p>

          I hesitated to do the Tonglen meditation. It requires you to focus on
          bad things and turn them into something good. I thought it was going to
          be too painful to do. It was... OK. I rather not make it a habit.

        <p class="body">
          How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? I felt
          that some parts of it were tough to grasp. I didn't really feel a status
          threat: I'm a student. I know nothing. What status do I have? Certainty?
          I'm a student, I'm not certain of anything. As for autonomy, I did appreciate
          the opportunities to learn on my own schedule and figure out that I needed
          to improve upon - so that is self-assuring. As for relatedness, I kinda
          figure that we're all at EDA for good reason, so there's good reason to
          interact with everyone. As for fairness, I think this one is the one I was
          most concerned about: I wanted to make sure that I put in an effort to
          learn things on my own terms. Sometimes that resulted in looking at code early,
          or asking for help, and I realise others have put in time and effort. I hope
          I've been fair to those I've worked with in the past and respectful of
          peoples' time.

        <p class="body">
          As for hard conversations: Those are never easy and they never get easy, I find.
          I've reflected on some toughies I've had in my life (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-Conversations-Talking-Stakes-Second/dp/1469266822"><em>Crucial Conversations</em></a> is a great book). I don't feel comfortable sharing details of such
          talks online, but suffice it to say that preparation helps, practice helps, and going in with
          an even tone, calm demeanor and a goal of mutual benefit usually helps.
