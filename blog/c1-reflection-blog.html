<h2>On starting  Dev Academy this week </h2>

<p>When I first learned about Dev Academy, I wanted to apply within the first hour. I took a few weeks to think about it, because spending $11,000 should be a considered decision. Right? I liked the curriculum, I knew I wanted to learn JavaScript, and I wanted to plug the holes in my knowledge of kindergarten-level web development.</p>
<p>I looked forward to the sort of learning environment that Dev Academy offers. I didn't mind that the programme is new in Auckland, or that curriculum changes, or that there's not a "degree" on the back end. I figured if I put in the work to learn, the whole experience will be worth the effort.</p><p>After watching the DBC video, nothing really surprised me about the culture or the operations. This week, I think my worry is keeping up and potentially not learning what I need to be learning. That is scary.</p> 
<p>I think right now, I'm <em>that student</em> who feels like she's the dumbest one in the room. I knew enough HTML and CSS to do my current job. I knew NOTHING about the command line. So I struggled to learn a new language, in order to get my assignments in on time. That was incredibly intimidating. But I learned enough to get the assignment done.</p>

<p>It felt good to get that command line assignment in, but I feel I might have cheated myself. (I haven't cheated. At least my intent has not been to cheat. I spent an hour this morning trying to figure out how to add text to an html file without going straight to GitHub and just editing the file there.)</p>
<p>I don't like this feeling, wondering if everyone else nailed the concept and I'm just scraping by. I fear that I'm not doing my part in giving and getting the most out of this experience. My biggest concern after week 1 is just making sure I'm making the time and the effort all worth it.</p>
