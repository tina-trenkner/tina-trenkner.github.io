	<h2>Meditation and process</h2>

	<p>This week, our cohort was told to redesign our blogs, prioritising "process over product". To me, this meant figuring out the changes I'd like to see on the site, and working to find a solution and why that solution works. It may be better to create a simple responsive site than to worry about it looking amazing. The looking amazing can come later. </p>

  <p>If we get frustrated, then we can take a mini-break. A little two-minute meditation, which is what our friend Meng is suggesting in chapter 2 of <em>Search Inside Yourself</em>. His meditation method are simple, and you can switch between them. The two methods are sitting quietly, focusing on your breathing while maintaining a clear head, or simply sitting there with no agenda.</p>

  <p>However you decide to sit there, either breathing or sitting with no agenda, is up to you. You can leave your eyes open or closed - I leave mine slightly open or else I will fall asleep. If something pops up in my brain while I'm sitting there, I notice it and try to let it go. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0MK7qz13bU">LET IT GOOOOOO</a>)
  </p>

  <p>Meng suggested that with a continual practice, you can actually build your ability to manage your emotions better. This can actually train the mind to have a happier state of being. And that can contribute to better health (although correlation does not imply causation.) So if you want to get happier, and less frustrated (when your code never seems to work), take a two-minute breather. A few of these can improve your well-being.</p>

  <p>As I've mentioned in past posts, I find it hard to sit still for two minutes. Two minutes is nothing, I need to stop whingeing. I should think of it as a two minute investment in my own well-being and do it more often.</p>
