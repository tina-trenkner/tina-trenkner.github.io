          What do you think of people who complain about their jobs? That they hate their boss/work/job? Are they just lame and annoying, or can you relate? I think there's probably a spectrum of satisfaction, regardless of whatever your job is. You have good days, you have bad days.
        </p>

        <p class="body">
        Then there are people who are just <em>miserable</em> with their job. The culprit? They're not doing something that they enjoy. It's not energizing them. It's draining them. And that just starts a spiral of suck.
        </p>

        <p class="body">
         In chapter six of Search Inside Yourself, Meng talks about "pleasure, passion and purpose". Your work is more likely to be deeply satisfying when you're working towards a higher purpose, you have passion for that work, and sometimes you get immense pleasure for it. But in order to find that job that will invoke all of these, it takes a lot of self-reflection.
        </p>

        <p class="body">
          I tried Meng's journaling exercise last night. And I have to admit, I think there's more self-reflection to do here. The word "integrity" was something I kept coming back to, to the point where I thought I might not actually understand what the word means. According to Oxford, integrity is "The quality of being honest and having strong moral principles". I think I keep coming back to this value because I like working for places that have a mission. Maybe I get satisfaction from having a mission as a higher purpose.
        </p>

        <p class="body">
          As for what I stand for: The word respect pops up in my mind often. I want to help bring respect to others' work, and respect the people who utilise the work I do.
        </p>

        <p class="body">
          I feel I still have a bit of reflection to do here. The meditation and self-reflection techniques will help with this.
        </p>

        <p class="body">
          I'm hesitant to take on the resilience exercise Meng sets out for us. It involves spending 4 minutes reflecting on how the body reacts to the memory of failure. That hurts too much. (Apologies for the self-pity here). But I need to try and do it. Because emotions are just feelings of the body. And if you (or I) can observe them and not let them dictate behaviour, that builds... *drumroll* resilience!
