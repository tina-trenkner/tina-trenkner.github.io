        <h3 class="blog">Problem-solving when you're faced with JavaScript</h3>
        <p class="body">
          Let me tell you about a time I got stuck on a simple problem: At the time, the problem didn't look simple. It was likely a JavaScript lesson. Here is how I learned to figure it out:
          <ul>
          <li>Sigh</li>
          <li>Rub my temples</li>
          <li>Google the issue</li>
          <li>Curse at my computer when Google yields nothing helpful</li>
          <li>"Walk away" from the problem (aka watch YouTube, check Facebook, talk to a friend)
          <li>Come back to the problem</li>
          <li>Try something, anything. Change a punctuation mark.</li>
          <li>Realise that the issue was as little as an incorrect punctuation mark.</li>
          <li>Feel silly.</li>
          <li>Repeat this process again with another issue.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>

      <p class="body">
        There's many a time in which if I just took a deep breath, cleared my head and re-attacked the issue, I could have had the answer much easier. And if an answer wasn't clear, at least the fact that I needed help would have been more clear.
      </p>

      <p class="body">
        Now, has there ever been a time I solved an issue in an elegant way? If we're talking in terms of elegant JavaScript, then the answer is not yet. Upon reflection, my learning needs right now is to write things in an inelegant manner because my maths and logic skills are weaker than my other skills. I figure I need to "go slow to go fast", so right now, the elegant JavaScript needs to take a backseat. Eventually, I'll be able to simplify and write clean, elegant code. But now, I need to write out the mess to understand it.
      </p>

      <p class="body">
        That said, I've done some elegant solutions in clearing up potential issues in a previous career. Those solutions I won't write here, but I can share over a beer sometime. Diplomacy can be a very elegant solution. Perhaps there are some parallels between diplomacy and elegant code. Someone needs to write that book. In those situations, I would:
        <ul><li>Take a step back to understand the problem</li>
          <li>Consider a few options to solve that issue</li>
          <li>Perhaps "walk away" from the issue to see if I develop any strong reactions to any of the options. (Sometimes, your gut is really good as sussing things out.)</li>
          <li>After "walking away", come back and select the simplest option. Simple measures have less steps to muck up.</li>
          <li>Execute said option.</li>
          <li>Assess the option to see if it solved the issue. If it did, hooray! If it didn't, loop back (a while loop, that is), until the solution is solved.</li>
          <ul>
      <p>

        <p class="body">
          I've been thinking a lot lately about how to improve my logical reasoning skills, because many of the problems in this sprint that I've had were because my mind couldn't figure out where to start. So here are some of the methods I've used and what I think of them:
          <ul>
            <li>Pseudocode: Where you write out what you want to do, then figure out the syntax to do it. I feel somewhat confident about using it. This kinda works for me; it at least makes the problem clearer in my mind. I think this will be a better solution as I get more familiar with JavaScript terminology. </li>
            <li>Trying <em>something</em>: Just give it a go. I feel somewhat confident about using this. I like this method because it seems like its an effort to solve the problem. I fear that when I do this, it's just a waste of time though.</li>
            <li>Rubber ducky method: This method I feel very confident using. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh85R-S-dh8">So does Ernie</a>. Basically, you explain the problem as if you are talking to a rubber ducky. This works for me. It makes me consider the problem in clear terms. Plus, this method appeals to the kid in me.</li>
            <li>Reading error messages: I could feel more confident using this. This doesn't help me. If my solution doesn't do what I want it to, I don't need an error message. Although, I should be more literate in error messages.</li>
            <li>Console logging: I feel meh about using this. I don't think I use it all that often. Maybe I should do it more often. </li>
            <li>Googling: I feel very comfortable asking Mr. Google for help. Stack Overflow is great. Bucky Roberts is great. 10/10. </li>
            <li>Asking peers for help: I feel very comfortable going on to Slack and asking for help. Possibly to the chagrin of the Slack group? </li>
            <li>Asking coaches for help: I feel very comfortable with this method, but I'd rather go through the other methods before I go to a coach.</li>
            <li>Improving with reflection: I like using this method, but I could do it better. Perhaps I can do a daily diary on what I've learned each day.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p class="body">
          We've had to do quite a bit with manipulating arrays this week. Here are what the following array functions do:
          <ul><li>.map(): Map basically applies a function to every item in a list of items. Whatever the result is - that result makes up a new list [array]. The input list is an array; the answer is a new list [array].</li>
            <li>.filter(): Filter is kind of self descriptive. Say you have a grocery list [array], and you only want the items that meet a certain condition (let's say you want a list of all the items you need from the dairy section). Applying filter with the condition you want (maybe 'dairy' will be in the item name) will return a new list [array] with those items that meet your condition.</li>
            <li>.reduce(): Reduce takes everything in a list and sums it up in one value. Let's go back to our grocery list, and let's say we give a price to each item. Reduce will take the prices of all those items and return one total figure. </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
