          <strong>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</strong>. Trick question! They're the same thing! Both are the ability to observe one's self objectively. These terms are just different terms used by two different people. That said, if you can cultivate this concept, it could make you happier and more productive.
        </p>

        <p class="body">
          <strong>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</strong>: Today, I tried the body scan while at the library trying to complete the week 4 sprint a day late. I brought my attention to my feet and worked my way up. I realised I had tension in my lower back, shoulders and jaw (the sweet stress points). I wasn't totally surprised that I felt tension here; I usually do. I took this as an indicator that I'm feeling under pressure. (Trying to learn JavaScript will do that to ya.)
        </p>

        <p class="body">
         <strong>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</strong>: I took that how I feel doesn't define me. Just because I'm angry doesn't mean I'm an angry person. Just because I'm happy doesn't mean I'm a happy person. Feelings are temporary and can change, and I don't have to ride those emotions out. It's actually better if I don't. So that said, I should step back from my frustrations with JavaScript. It's only a temporary feeling, I'm more than just a confused and frustrated EDA student. :)
