        <p class="body">
          This week, we read chapter 7 of <em>Search Inside Yourself</em>. The chapter focused on empathy, or the ability to connect and relate to others, to recognise their emotional states. Empathy is something we natually have but can work to cultivate, and the products can help in the personal and professional realms.
        </p>

        <p class="body">
          There are a number of exercises provided to work on our sense of empathy. Empathetic listening pulls on some lessons we learned in an earlier chapter. It's the ability to listen, reflect and identify how someone is feeling given the topic of conversation. (I found that one of the phrase's the author uses an odd one: "What I hear you feel is..." Call it the English nerd in me, but you hear sounds, you feel impacts. I get what the phrase is supposed to me, mayber there is a function hidden in there that makes this phrase work. ;) ) I feel like I use this in my everyday job, in which people with different goals need to come together. It really helps to repeat back what people feel because when someone feels recognised, they are more likely to stay in engaged with whatever process we're involved in.
        </p>

        <p class="body">
          I found the loving kindness meditation very relaxing. Even a bit emotional. Probably because I feel very rushed in my life at the moment and having a chance to sit down and not be so self-interested for a second was a relief and a reminder that others matter, their feelings matter. The author says that cultivating this sense of kindness to others is a "sustainable source of happiness" - something to practice more often.
        </p>

        <p class="body">
          I think I learned the most from the political organisation exercise. Before I read the section, I thought this would be in reference to politics in a social science sense - what the author meant here was the politics of a given organisation. As I tried it out, I thought of a common conflict editors and writers can have with each other in any situation.
        </p>
        <p class="body">
          <strong>Writer</strong>: I have a fantastic idea for a project. It's about x and y and it will be incredibly informative and entertaining. Our audience will love it.
        </p>
        <p class="body">
          strong>Publisher</strong>: Yes, but we also need content that can be produced with the budget that we have. We also need to be able to attract advertisers with this content, and I'm not convinced it is in the interests of this organisation to pursue that project.
        </p>

        <p class="body">
          I mean, they can BOTH be right. (And to be fair, the roles could also be reversed. The publisher could have a fantastic project idea that the writer thinks is lame. They both could be correct.) So if both are right, how does the organisation move forward?
        </p>

        <p class="body">
          Hopefully in a situation like this, there is enough respect between the parties that both can come to a common agreement. That agreement may not be palatable to both, but both agree that one party has the right to make a call and the other needs to respect it. (Hopefully both parties engaged in empathetic listening here.)
        </p>

        <p class="body">
          What I appreciated most out of this chapter is that kindness has a place in business settings and can yield great things for anyone and everyone involved.
        </p>
