	<h2>HTML, CSS and DOM Part II</h2>

	<p>In a follow up to some initial reflections on <a href="http://tina-trenkner.github.io/blog/t2-html-css-dom-p1.html">HTML, CSS and DOM</a>: </p>

	<ul>
		<li>
		<strong>What is grid-based design?</strong>: Grid-based design is the idea that elements are laid out on a webpage between rows and columns. Things don't just float around on a page... (Wait, I guess items can float with CSS). It's the idea that elements are laid out in a logical way: Top to bottom, left to right. 
		</li>

		<li>
		<strong>What's all the hype about responsive design?</strong>: What are you, my bosses? Responsive design is on the mind of every digital publisher. Responsive design is the ability for a website to adapt to whatever browser it is seen in. Regardless of whether you are on desktop, or a mobile device, that website you are browsing will show up and function beautifully. And with more and more users accessing the internet via mobile and Google ranking mobile-friendly websites higher in search, the importance of a responsive website cannot be understated.
		</li>

		<li><strong>What is semantic structure?</strong>: It's a way to organise information (elements) on a page. Big titles may require an h1, your subheads may deserve an h2, and your even smaller sub-subheads may need an h3.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>To be honest, I'm having a bit of a tough time grasping the CSS stylesheet laid out in the Udacity course. Maybe it is because it's late in the evening as I write this. But I will need to replay the snippets on CSS and columns a few times before I nail the concept.</p>
