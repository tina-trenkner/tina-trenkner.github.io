        <p class="body">
          In JavaScript, one of the most important concepts to grasp is <em>scope</em>. It's kind of like determining what is public space and what is private space, and it helps shape how a function and variables work.
        </p>

        <p class="body">
          There's two scopes to learn: Global and local. Think of global scope as a big public park where anyone can play around. Set up a frisbee game right next to a picnic. Set up anything you want! Lots of activity can coexist here. Any variable set up in global scope can be referenced across the code.
        </p>

        <p class="body">
          Now think of a little shop in the park, a coffee cafe or something. It's part of the park, but its private and self-contained. You can't play frisbee in the coffee shop, you probably shouldn't have a picnic in a coffee shop. That coffee shop has one thing to offer but it's still of benefit to the wider park. That shop embodies local scope - a contained function that contributes to the wider effort. (Who doesn't love a walk throught the park with a warm cuppa?)
        </p>

        <p class="body">
          Now, what happens if there is a variable with the same name in local and global scope? They're not the same thing. The variable in local scope is only affected by code within the brackets. So depending on what the code is and where it is, that variable with the same name could come out with two different outcomes. This is why it's smart to give every variable a unique name. Don't call your public park "coffee shop" and don't call your public park "coffee shop". You'll just confuse everyone.
