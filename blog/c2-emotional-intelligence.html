	<h2>Encountering Emotional Intelligence</h2>

	<p>In the first chapter of <em>Search Inside Yourself</em> by Chande-Meng Tan, we learn that emotional intelligence (or the ability to recognise, relate and empathise with others and use that for greater gains) is something that can be developed. It's not innate. And those who do develop their emotional intelligence can see great gains in his or her personal and or professional life. I don't think Meng said this directly, but to me, emotional intelligence is a muscle that needs to be strengthened and exercised.
	<p>
	<p>Meng recommends taking two minutes a day to just sit and either focus on your breathing or just sit there without an agenda. The idea is that with this exercise, you may become more familiar with how your body is reacting to that moment in time. Those two minutes can create greater positive change in one's life. 
	</p>
	<p>I think this is an easy habit to complete, but a difficult one to integrate into daily life. You would think that two minutes is easy to do, but it's also easy to tell yourself "It's two minutes, so it's not really all that important." This, admittedly, is something I can work on.
