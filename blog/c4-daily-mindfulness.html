        <p class="body">
          This week, Meng encouraged our cohort to engage in a mindfulness conversation - to make an effort to be fully present in conversation, giving the person we're speaking to our full attention, making sure they know they have our full attention, and checking in with ourselves to reflect on the experience. 
        <p>

        <p class="body">
          I used this technique this week when an application I use at work was not working. The program was "telling" me information that would have had a big impact on that day's operations, and I needed someone to verify if what the program was telling me was correct.
        </p>

        <p class="body">
          To do this, I went over to my colleague's desk and asked if he or she had a minute for a question. I laid out my concerns, and the colleague responded to them (which provided the opportunity to listen mindfully). After the colleague shared the response, I said "OK, let me make sure I understand this correctly, you are saying x, y, z..." (This is the "looping" the author speaks of).
        </p>

        <p class="body">
          The colleague confirmed what I had understood correctly and clarified what I misunderstood. After that, I took a pause to reconsider the situation given this interchange (aka "dipping"), checked in with my general feeling and sense of the situation, then went back to work to continue the day's operations. 
        </p>

        <p class="body">
          I believe I have an opportunity to strengthen my "looping" skills, making a better effort to listen and repeat back what someone is telling me. My brain goes off in too many directions and I have a difficult time giving my full attention to one thing at a time. Strengthening my looping skills could help create better bonds among colleagues and can only make future collaborations better. 
        </p>
